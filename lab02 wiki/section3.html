        When working out or training, it is important to workout properly. Not only does it benefit you in that you wont get injured when using proper technique, with proper technique, you are able to develope muscle faster and more effeiciently. It is also important to seperate the muscle groups into training days. For example, lets say you start working out on a Monday. Mondays could be *leg day* which is when you focus on your leg muscles such as your quadraceps, calve muscles, hamstrings, and glutes. Tuesday could be a *push day* or *bicep and chest day* where you would focus on your pectoral muscles and your biceps. Wednesday could be a *shoulder day* where you workout your shoulders, delts, and traps. Lastly, Thursday could be a *pull day* where you would train your back muscles and triceps. For friday, Saturday, and Sunday, you can use those as rest days or focus on cario or core day. It is important to do each excercise with the proper weight so you do not strain or hurt yourself and also to do each repitition of the exercise you do to the best of your ability so you more efficiently grow muscle.
